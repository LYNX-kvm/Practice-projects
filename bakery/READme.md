**Project Brief: Bakery Website**

**Company Name: Sweet Treats Bakery**

**Objective:**
I need a small, simple website to promote my bakery. It should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and responsive for mobile users. I don't need any JavaScript functionalities yet, just a clean design using HTML and CSS.

**Pages:**
**Home Page**

- A welcoming header with the bakery's name.
- A brief introduction (2–3 sentences) about the bakery.
- A large image of baked goods (you can use a placeholder image for now).
- A simple “Visit Us” section with the address and hours of operation.
- A footer with links to other sections and contact details.

**Menu Page**

- A list of items we offer (use at least 5 categories, e.g., Cakes, Cookies, Pastries, Bread, Drinks).
- Each category should have at least 3 items with a brief description and price.
  **Contact Page**
- A form for customers to reach out (Name, Email, Message fields).
- Contact information (Address, Phone Number).
- Embedded Google Maps image (for now, you can use a placeholder image).

**Design Guidelines:**

- Use warm and inviting colors (browns, creams, pastel shades).
- Make sure the fonts are clean and easy to read (consider using Google Fonts).
- The website should be responsive (use media queries to adjust the layout for mobile screens).

**Deadline:**
Take your time! There’s no hard deadline, but let’s say a week or two for completion.
